### Compiling from Source

Make sure `flatpak` and `git` are installed, then run the following to build from the repo:
```bash
# Clone this repo and enter it
git clone https://github.com/flattool/ignition
cd ignition

# Install build dependencies
flatpak install org.flatpak.Builder org.gnome.Sdk//48 org.gnome.Platform//48 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node20//24.08 -y

# Build and install Ignition
flatpak run org.flatpak.Builder _build ./build-aux/io.github.flattool.Ignition.json --install --user --force-clean
```

### Formatting

Ignition uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code formatting.
- Install using `pip install pre-commit`
- Run `pre-commit install` in the Ignition repository root to set up pre-commit for this repo.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to format all files in the repository.

If you run into a situation where pre-commit is broken, you can use `git commit --no-verfiy` to skip the pre-commit checks.
